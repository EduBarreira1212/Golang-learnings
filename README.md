## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd go-learnings
````

2. **Navigate to a topic and run an example:**

   ```bash
   cd 6-struct
   go run main.go
   ```

   Replace `6-struct` with any other topic folder you'd like to explore.

3. **Install dependencies (if needed):**
   Some examples use third-party packages. To ensure everything works:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```
